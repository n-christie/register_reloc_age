## Scania Outdoor Environment Database (ScOut)

- **Swedish Name**: ScOut
- **Description**: To be able to study the effects and complexity of multiple perceived outdoor environment characteristics on health and well-being and reduce single-source bias, we compiled a database based on the available resources in Scania, southern Sweden, 2008–2019, including area-aggregated assessments of 24 characteristics. We found that PSDs were robust to seasonal changes. We observed clear visible patterns between different characteristics, with correlations between them ranging from negligible to strong, confirming the complexity of the perceived environment. ScOut is a unique data source in its nature and size, in Sweden and abroad, covering areas where approximately 97% of the population live.

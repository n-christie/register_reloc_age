Welcome to the Register Reloc-Age Project, a comprehensive analysis of housing choices and relocation patterns among individuals aged 55 and above.

The register study includes approximately five million participants born between 1908 and 1961 and their partners (the latter regardless of age) from the Register of the Total Population in Sweden, with the study period between 1987 and 2021 (or until death or moving abroad). We will follow up all individuals in the study up to the age of 35 using registers. Data on living environment, including geocodes for residential address, as well as health and well-being, are obtained from the Statistics Authority Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare. The data is analyzed using statistical methods.

All personal data processed is pseudonymised. This means that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific registered person without supplementary data being used. The code keys are stored separately at Statistikmyndigheten SCB until 2024-03-31 to enable updates with later years and additions to the material. When the project is finished, the data will be archived according to standard procedures for archiving research data at Lund University. 

The project is approved by the Ethics Review Authority, no. 2020-01369 and dnr. 2021-01124, with Lund University as principal.

# Data Integration and Linkage

## Overview

This project combines data from multiple register sources provided by Statistics Sweden (SCB) and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Integrating these datasets enables comprehensive analyses of housing choices, health outcomes, socioeconomic status, and demographic trends. The integration process primarily involves linking individual records across datasets using unique identifiers and ensuring data consistency across time and sources.

## Linkage Methodology

Each dataset includes unique personal identifiers that allow for accurate matching across registers. The primary identifier used for linkage is the **Personal Identity Number (PIN)**, assigned to each resident in Sweden. This identifier enables the seamless integration of information from different datasets, ensuring that all data points accurately correspond to the same individual.

### Steps in the Linkage Process

1. **Data Standardization**: Each dataset was reviewed to ensure consistent formatting of the PIN and other relevant variables used in the linkage process.
2. **Primary Linkage Using PIN**: The Personal Identity Number serves as the primary key for linking data across registers.
3. **Secondary Checks**: In cases where additional verification was required, variables like **birth date** and **sex** were used to confirm the linkage.

### Example Linkage

An example of the linkage process would involve connecting records from the **Total Population Register** and the **National Patient Register**. Using the PIN, we link demographic data (e.g., birth date, sex, migration details) with health data (e.g., diagnoses, treatments) for the same individual. This linkage enables us to analyze health outcomes in the context of demographic factors.

## Challenges in Data Integration

Integrating multiple large datasets poses several challenges, including:

- **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Some datasets required reformatting to ensure compatibility across registers. For example, date formats and categorical variables like employment status were standardized.
- **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some records in individual registers had missing values for certain variables, particularly for older data entries. Missing values were managed carefully to avoid biases in analyses.
- **Changes Over Time**: Registers have undergone updates, including changes in variable definitions and data collection methods. These changes were documented and accounted for during integration to maintain data consistency.

## Quality Control Measures

To ensure the accuracy of the integrated dataset, the following quality control measures were implemented:

1. **Cross-Verification**: After linkage, a subset of records was cross-verified across multiple registers. For example, age, sex, and other demographic details were compared across sources to confirm consistency.
2. **Missing Data Checks**: Missing values were flagged and examined to assess their impact on analyses. Imputation methods were applied only where it was appropriate, and records with critical missing information were handled based on predefined rules.
3. **Duplicate Record Removal**: Each dataset was checked for duplicate entries based on the PIN and relevant timestamp information, ensuring only unique records per individual and time point.

## Data Processing Pipeline

The integration process follows a structured data processing pipeline:

1. **Data Extraction**: Data is extracted from each register using standardized methods, ensuring that only necessary variables and records are included.
2. **Cleaning and Transformation**: Each dataset undergoes cleaning and transformation, including standardization of formats, handling of missing values, and filtering for relevant time periods.
3. **Linkage and Verification**: Datasets are linked using the PIN, with additional verification steps applied to ensure accuracy.
4. **Final Quality Assurance**: The integrated dataset undergoes a final quality check, including consistency checks and validation against known statistics (e.g., population demographics).

## Ethical Considerations

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, strict ethical guidelines were followed throughout the integration process. All personal identifiers were handled in compliance with data privacy regulations, and access to identifiable information was restricted to authorized personnel only.

# About the Project

## Background

The Register RELOC-AGE prjoect is an essential part of the overall RELOC-AGE Program.  The program investigates how housing choices and revocations impact active and healthy aging among individuals aged 55 and above. By analyzing patterns in housing decisions and their effects on health outcomes, the project aims to generate significant insights into the aging process.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the RELOC-AGE project are to:

1. **Study housing choices, relocation, and health patterns in the Swedish population aged 55+ (Register RELOC-AGE).**
2. **Examine the effects of housing choices and relocation on active and healthy ageing among individuals considering relocation aged 55+ (Prospective RELOC-AGE).**
3. **Complete the development of a novel housing counseling intervention and conduct a pilot study (Intervention RELOC-AGE).**
4. **Contribute to theory development on housing choices, relocation, and active ageing (Theory RELOC-AGE).**

## Research Questions

The project is guided by several research questions, which are categorized as follows:

### Housing Trends and Health Impacts

1. **What are the trends in housing types and tenures over time by age?**
2. **How do housing aspects and relocation decisions influence future health outcomes?**

    - How are these patterns affected by factors such as age, sex, civil status, country of origin, adverse health events, loss of a partner, socio-economic and neighborhood characteristics?
    - Given equal propensity of relocation based on demographic, socio-economic, and health characteristics, how do specific housing decisions affect future health outcomes?

### Adverse Health Events and Relocation Patterns

1. **What are the effects of adverse health events on housing choices and relocation?**
    - What are the short- and long-term effects?
    - How do these effects differ by gender, disease or disability profiles, civil status, country of origin, and socio-economic status?

### Housing and Health Predictors of Relocation

1. **Which aspects of housing and health predict:**
    - Relocation to different housing options within the general housing market?
    - Relocation to residential care facilities?
    - Remaining in one's current dwelling?

### Housing, Social Aspects, and Active Ageing

1. **How do objective and perceived aspects of housing and social factors interact with active and healthy ageing?**
2. **What are the characteristics and trajectories of these dynamics?**

### Housing Preferences in Older Adults

1. **Which housing attributes are important for older adults considering relocation?**
2. **How do they prioritize these attributes in their decision-making?**
3. **What reasoning do older adults use when considering relocation options?**
    - What are their motives for considering and implementing relocation?
    - To what extent are their motives fulfilled?

### Housing Counselling Intervention

1. **Is the newly developed housing counseling intervention feasible, usable, and acceptable within the Swedish municipal context?**
2. **What are the pros and cons of different delivery formats for this intervention?**
3. **Which outcomes should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of housing counseling?**
    - Responsiveness and impact on primary and secondary outcomes, as demonstrated by the pilot study.

### Theory Development

1. **What are the core concepts and pathways for a theory on housing choices, relocation, and active ageing?**

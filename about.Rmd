# About the Project

## Background

The Reloc-Age project investigates how housing choices and relocations impact active and healthy aging among individuals aged 55 and above. By analyzing patterns in housing decisions and their effects on health outcomes, the project aims to generate significant insights into the aging process.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the Reloc-Age project are:

- **Study Housing Choices and Relocation Patterns**: Examine trends over time and by age in housing types and tenures among the Swedish population aged 55+.

- **Assess Health Outcomes**: Analyze how housing aspects and relocations affect future health outcomes, considering factors such as age, sex, civil status, country of origin, adverse health events, loss of a partner, socio-economic status, and neighborhood characteristics.

- **Develop Housing Counseling Interventions**: Create and pilot a novel housing counseling intervention tailored for older adults considering relocation.

- **Contribute to Theory Development**: Advance theoretical frameworks related to housing choices, relocation, and active aging.

## Research Questions

The project addresses several key research questions:

1. What are the trends over time and by age regarding housing types and tenures?

2. How do housing aspects and relocations affect future health outcomes?

   - How are these patterns influenced by factors such as age, sex, civil status, country of origin, adverse health events, loss of a partner, socio-economic status, and neighborhood characteristics?

   - Given equal propensity for relocation based on baseline demographic, socio-economic, and health characteristics, how do specific housing decisions impact future health outcomes?

3. What are the effects of adverse health events on housing choices and relocation patterns?

   - What are the short- and long-term effects?

   - How do these effects differ between men and women, across different disease and/or disability profiles, civil status, country of origin, and socio-economic status?

4. What aspects of housing and health predict:

   - Relocation to different housing options in the ordinary housing stock

   - Relocation to residential care facilities

   - Remaining in the present dwelling

5. How is the complex interaction between objective and perceived aspects of housing and social factors associated with active and healthy aging, and what are the characteristics and trajectories of such dynamics?

6. What housing attributes do older adults considering relocation find important, and to what extent, when making their decisions on housing preferences?

7. How do older adults considering relocation reason regarding:

   - Different housing options

   - Motives for considering and effectuating relocation

   - To what extent are their motives fulfilled?

8. Is the newly developed housing counseling intervention usable, feasible, and acceptable for the Swedish municipality context, and what are the pros and cons of different delivery formats?

9. Which outcomes should be used to investigate the effectiveness of housing counseling, and what are:

   - The responsiveness and

   - The intervention effects on the selected primary and secondary outcomes, as indicated by the results of the pilot study?

10. What are the main concepts and pathways of a theory on housing choices, relocation, and active aging?

## Team

The Reloc-Age project is conducted by a multidisciplinary team of researchers specializing in gerontology, public health, sociology, and housing studies. The team's diverse expertise ensures a comprehensive approach to understanding the complexities of housing and aging.

## Funding and Acknowledgments
